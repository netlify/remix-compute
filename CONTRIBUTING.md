## Development process

First fork and clone the repository. If you're not sure how to do this, please watch
[these videos](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

### Installation

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

This installs all the dependencies for all the packages and builds the `@netlify/remix-runtime`,
`@netlify/remix-adapter`, `@netlify/remix-edge-adapter`, and `@netlify/vite-plugin-react-router` packages.

### Testing

To build the packages, run the build command.

```bash
pnpm run build:packages
```

Run the build watch command to have packages built when they are changed.

```bash
pnpm run build:packages:watch
```

To run unit tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:unit
```

To run all tests (including linting and typechecking):

```bash
pnpm run test
```

#### End-to-end integration tests

These tests are meant to be very terse, basic, happy-path "user journey" system tests. These should generally map to
user-facing features and should rarely be added to.

Prerequisites:

- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed globally
- Install Playwright browsers (it should prompt you automatically the first time):
  - `pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps`

To run end-to-end integration tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e
```

To add a new fixture site called `my-fixture`:

1. create a new directory `tests/e2e/fixtures/my-fixture`
2. register it in `tests/e2e/support/fixtures` as `myFixture`
3. [inject `myFixture` directly into any test](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#using-a-fixture)

## How to write commit messages

We use [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to automate version management.

Most common commit message prefixes are:

- `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and generate a patch release.
- `feat:` which represents a new feature, and generate a minor release.
- `feat!:`, `fix!:` or `refactor!:` and generate a major release.
