# Remix Adapter for Netlify

The Remix Adapter for Netlify allows you to deploy your [Remix](https://remix.run) app to
[Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/).

It is strongly advised to use [the Netlify Remix template](https://github.com/netlify/remix-template) to create a Remix
site for deployment to Netlify. See [Remix on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/remix/) for more details and
other options.

Please note that this adapter **does not support Hydrogen**. Hydrogen is only supported via Edge Functions. See
<https://github.com/netlify/hydrogen-template>.
