# Demos

These are demo sites intended to aid local development.

Some of these may also be configured to be deployed to Netlify automatically on PRs.

## Running

Prerequisites:

- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed globally
- Follow the "Installation" steps in the [root README](../README.md)

Choose a demo to run (e.g. `demos/vite-edge`) and run:

```bash
netlify serve --filter=vite-edge
```
